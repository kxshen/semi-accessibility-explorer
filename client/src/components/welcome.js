              Getting to where you need to go in SE Michigan can be difficult, and the pandemic has made it even harder. Perhaps you have an excruciating commute, or are familiar with stories of neighbors getting by without a car.

              Transportation wonks call this ability to "get where you need to go" <b>accessibility</b>, and have written stacks of academic books and papers on the topic. 
              But in trying to describe how easy it is for <i>you</i> to get around, they rarely make their work easily interpretable or incorporate <i>your</i> voices.

                This tool aims to shine a new light on well-known stories of inaccessibility, such as the <Link color="teal.400" href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2015/01/31/detroit-commuting-troy-rochester-hills-smart-ddot-ubs-banker-woodward-buses-transit/22660785/">
